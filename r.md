# CMJ Velocity Prediction Model: XGBoost with SHAP Analysis - Comprehensive Performance and Feature Importance Analysis

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This analysis is based exclusively on Countermovement Jump (CMJ) data and reflects lower body power, reactive strength, and movement efficiency only. These predictions DO NOT account for upper body strength, arm strength, or throwing-specific biomechanics, which are also critical components of throwing velocity. The predicted velocity represents the athlete's capacity based on lower body force production characteristics and should be interpreted as one component of overall throwing ability, not a complete assessment of pitching potential.**

## SHAP Contribution Analysis

### SHAP Contribution Distributions

SHAP contribution percentages show how much each movement phase is responsible for your individual velocity prediction. 

**Why Target the Elite Distribution**: Analysis of 142 athletes who throw 90+ mph (vs. overall dataset average) reveals the optimal biomechanical pattern. Elite throwers show significantly different patterns in key phases compared to the general population.

**Elite vs Bottom 10% Performance Comparison**: The contrast between top and bottom performers reveals critical biomechanical differences:

| Phase | Elite (Top 10%) | Bottom 10% | Difference | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Concentric** | 35.8% | 42.0% | -6.2% | Bottom performers over-rely on raw power |
| **Eccentric** | 18.4% | 15.8% | +2.6% | Elite have better loading capacity |
| **Landing** | 12.1% | 8.6% | +3.5% | Elite have superior stability and control |
| **Braking** | 5.8% | 5.1% | +0.7% | Elite more efficient in transitions |
| **Takeoff** | 4.1% | 4.8% | -0.7% | Elite waste less energy in final phase |


**Training Logic**: Target the elite distribution (17.9% eccentric, 36.4% concentric, 5.7% braking, 11.6% landing, 4.3% takeoff). If you're far from these targets, that indicates the phase most likely to improve your velocity potential.

**How to Interpret the Scores**: These percentages always add up to 100% for each athlete, representing the complete breakdown of what drives their velocity prediction. A high percentage in one area means that particular movement phase is the primary driver of their predicted velocity, while low percentages indicate that phase is less influential for that specific athlete.

**Concentric Contribution (Average 36%)**: This represents the upward, power-generating phase of the jump. Athletes with high concentric contributions (>42%) are "power throwers" whose velocity prediction is primarily driven by their ability to generate explosive force during the upward movement. These athletes typically have strong leg muscles and excel at rapid force production. A low concentric contribution (<30%) suggests the athlete may need significant power development training to improve their velocity potential.

**Eccentric Contribution (Average 19%)**: This represents the downward, loading phase where the athlete controls their descent and stores elastic energy. Athletes with high eccentric contributions (>22%) demonstrate excellent movement control and force absorption capacity. Their ability to efficiently load and control the downward phase is a major factor in their velocity prediction. Interestingly, there's a strong negative correlation (-0.421) between eccentric and concentric contributions, meaning athletes tend to be stronger in one phase or the other, rarely both equally.

**Landing Contribution (Average 11%)**: This represents how well an athlete absorbs and redirects force upon landing. Athletes with high landing contributions (>13%) have superior force absorption mechanics and stability. 

**Braking Contribution (Average 6%)**: This represents the transition period where the athlete stops their downward movement and begins to reverse direction. Athletes with high braking contributions (>8%) excel at this critical transition moment. The strong positive correlation (0.684) between braking and eccentric contributions shows these phases work together - athletes good at controlling their descent are typically also good at the transition point.

**Takeoff Contribution (Average 5%)**: This represents the final explosive phase where the athlete leaves the ground. While it has the lowest average contribution, athletes with high takeoff contributions (>6%) demonstrate exceptional final force application and coordination.

**Practical Interpretation**: An athlete with 45% concentric, 15% eccentric, 12% landing, 5% braking, and 3% takeoff contributions would be classified as a power-dominant athlete who relies heavily on explosive upward force generation but may benefit from improving their loading and control phases. Conversely, an athlete with 25% concentric, 35% eccentric, 15% landing, 12% braking, and 8% takeoff would be more balanced but may need to focus on converting their excellent control into explosive power output.
